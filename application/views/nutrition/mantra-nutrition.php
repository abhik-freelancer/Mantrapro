                    "Junk food" generally refers to foods that contribute lots of calories but little nutritional value. these foods typically contain high levels of calories from sugar or fat with little protein, vitamins or minerals. Sometimes these foods contain preservatives too. Common junk foods includes salted snack foods, gum, candy, sweet desserts, fried fast foods and carbonated beverages.
