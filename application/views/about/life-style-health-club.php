Our health and bodies need to be treated like temples and considered sacred if we hope to live life fully and completely. Regular exercise will not only improve our health, it will help us think more clearly, boost creativity and manage the relentless stress that seems to dominate our days. And research has proven that exercise will not only add life to our years, it could add years to our life - hence the age old saying "Health is the Greatest Wealth!"</p>

                    <span style="color:#F8663F;font-weight:700;">Visual Acuity:</span> Vision is the appreciation of differences in the outside world. Visual Acuity is the measurement of the vision obtained. It is the clarity or sharpness of vision. The measurement of visual acuity gives a clue towards the ocular pathology. Good visual acuity is very important while driving, because it helps people recognize landmarks, avoid obstacles and read road signs.

                    <span style="color:#F8663F;font-weight:700;">Resting Pulse Rate or Heart Rate:</span> When you sit quietly, your heart slips into a slower, steady pace known as your resting heart rate. An increase in this rate over time may be a signal of heart trouble ahead. The usual range for resting heart rate lie in between 60 and 90 beats per minute. Above 90, it is considered high!

                <li>
                    <span style="color:#F8663F;font-weight:700;">Oxygen Saturation Level:</span> Through Oxygen Saturation level we can know how well your lungs are functioning in transferring oxygen to your blood. Your body needs a certain level of oxygen circulating in the blood to cells and tissues. In a healthy person with normal lung function when this level of oxygen falls below a certain level (&lt;95%), it indicates low oxygen levels in blood - a condition medically termed as hypoxemia which means the person would require medical investigation. According to World Health Organization, in a healthy person oxygen saturation levels in arterial blood lies in between 95 and 100 percent. Hypoxemia occurs and one may experience shortness of breath. Through the pulse oximeter we measures the saturation of oxygen in your blood, the results are often used as an estimate of blood oxygen levels. Under usual circumstances, normal pulse oximeter readings range from 95 to 100 percent. Values under 90 percent are considered low.

Endurance Test:</span> Just exercising on treadmill does not help much if one does not know how hard or how fast one needs to do it. Through endurance test the fitness trainer can assess your endurance ability (ability to resist fatigue for prolong period of time) for a particular group of muscle as well as for the whole body.

Your total body, particularly the cardiovascular and pulmonary system is examined through this test. Fitness trainers need this test result to design and monitor a perfect cardiovascular workout routine for an individual.

A person who is fit in the cardio respiratory sense of the word "fit", would have a higher VO2MAX than someone who is less fit. What it means is that your body is more able to absorb and use oxygen to generate energy for your muscle, and this will certainly give you an edge.

The harder your body works, the more oxygen it would burn to release the energy it needs to work and higher will be the METs level. Medical studies suggest improving your METs level may save your life. At complete rest, on an average, METs level will be 1.0 or 1 MET.

It also enables one to determine the efficiency of the training program and assess the progress he or she has made.

It does not differentiate between weight of muscle, fat and bones individually. With body fat percentage (%) calculation, we become aware about the fact that exactly how much extra fat we have in our body. For male, normal fat % should lie in between 12 to 17 whereas for female the normal being 22 to 27.

Fat in the abdominal region, known as visceral fat, is associated with greater risk of Type2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia. Standards are as follows - Men: no greater than 40 inches; Women: no greater than 34.6 inches. Ost-menopause women: No greater than 43.3 inches.

Adults who store most of their body fat around their waists have an increased risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke compared to those who have the same amount of body fat stored around their hips and thighs. Measuring one's waist-to-hip ratio is an easy way to see how much weight one is carrying around his or her abdomen as opposed to around the hips. It is designed for people aged 18 years and above. A healthy waist hip ratio for women is 0.8 or lower. A healthy ratio for men is 1.0 or lower. The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) states that women with waist-hip ratios of more than 0.8, and men with more than 1.0, are at increased health risk because of their body fat distribution pattern.

                One study of 18,000 Harvard alumni found that every hour spent on exercise added three hours to the participant's lives. Few investments will yield a better return than time spent on physical fitness. Remember: "Those who don't make time for exercise must eventually make time for illness." </p>
