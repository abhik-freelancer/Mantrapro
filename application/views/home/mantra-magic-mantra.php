					<p>Usually we measure our weight on weighing machine and compare that weight with a standard height weight chart to identify our ideal weight. Weighing machine only measures our over all weight which comprising of fat, muscles, bones weight.  It does not able to differentiate between weight of muscles, fat and bones. If a person having low body fat with heavy muscle and bones, standard height weight chart will identify that person as fatty or over weight. So standard height weight chart is not the perfect tool to measure your Ideal Body weight.  Nor BMI calculation. BMI calculation only considers Body weight and height. The formula for BMI is Bodyweight in kg/ Height in centimeter*.  So if a person develops more muscle in his body with an intensive training, according to BMI calculation he will always be considered to be an obese person. Or if a tall person wants to reduce extra body fat always ends up losing extra lean Body Mass, if he or she is following BMI calculation.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>For this reason MMWL package follow body composition assessment Guidelines. Body composition is used to describe the percentages of fat, bones and muscles in human body. It gives more details inside our body and Once we know the <span style="font-weight:800;">present percentages of fat</span> and muscles in our body,  <span style="font-weight:800;">ideal weight loss goal</span> can be set according to that percentage. Ideal weight loss involves loosing body fat while maintaining lean body mass (muscles and bones). MMWL package has been deigned in such a unique way it helps to reduce only unwanted fat while simultaneously maintaining lean body mass.</p>

		<h2><span style="color:#F2652C;font-weight:700;">Measurement</span></h2>
		<p>Measurement of Waist and Hip is important. The loss of inches is an indication of real success. Some times when weight loss is marginal but reduction in inches from waist and hip is more, indicates fat loss which is very much significant.  <span style="font-weight:800;">Inch loss is of fundamental importance, as it represents real fat loss.</span> </p>
		<p>Don't get obsessed with the weighing machine rather try a tight and discarded outfit which you could barely fit into and see the difference every week. The general guidelines regarding Ideal weight are useful for most of the people but not for all. So, don't stick to the rules strictly rather try to maintain the weight at which you feel most comfortable, look most attractive and can enjoy your life.</p>
